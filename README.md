# WFC-Engine

This is an JavaScript implementation of the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm (adjacent model). It's an "engine" for the algorithm, meaning it doesn't have any rendering capabilities. It's up to you to implement that. The engine generates a tilemap based on a set of tile rules and a grid size. The tile rules *could* be handcrafted, but it's better to let my [other project](https://github.com/NathanHinthorne/Wave-Function-Collapse) do that for you.

Copy and paste this code into your project to generate tilemaps in whatever way you see fit!
